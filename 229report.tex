\section{Motivation}

\IEEEPARstart{W}{ith} the growth of musical streaming services, there are now more songs than ever at music listeners fingertips. Because of this growth, the art of constructing playlists has become increasingly challenging, and discovering new music the in the expanse of choices is a daunting task. For this reason, we seek to build an automatic playlist generator, that can take a few songs as a seed set, and generate a complete playlist for the listener.

\subsection{Goal}
Using popular, human-curated playlists as our training data and test data, our system should construct playlists of similar quality. In particular, we plan to incorporate lyrical analysis in our model, as we believe that lyrical content is a big influence when creating playlists.

\section{Method}
We combine data from a number of sources in our project. The primary source is the Million Song Dataset \cite{msd} (MSD), and the corresponding lyrics dataset, which provided lyrics for roughly a quarter of those songs in a bag-of-words format. In addition to that we use Spotify \cite{spotify} as the source of our playlist data, as well as using their's and Last.fm's \cite{lastfm} song info to augment the data from the MSD.

In total, that gives us the following the following group of attributes:
\\\\
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Feature    & Value(s)       & Source          \\
Year       & TODO-TODO      & MSD, Spotify    \\
Tempo      & TODO-TODO      & MSD             \\
TODO       & TODO           & TODO            \\

TODO       & TODO           & TODO            \\
\end{tabular}

With these features, we approach the task two ways; first as a graph problem, and second as a classification problem.
